        "description": "# Fix Rename Directory Operation\n\nFix the known issue with directory rename operations to ensure they work correctly across all scenarios including nested directories and files.\n\n## Rationale\nThis is documented technical debt that affects the reliability of the library. The TODO in DemoCli indicates this is a known issue that needs resolution.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a .NET developer, I want to rename directories reliably so that I can test directory management code\n- As a library user, I expect rename operations to maintain consistency with nested contents\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Renaming a directory updates all child paths correctly\n- [ ] DirectoryRenamed event contains correct old and new paths\n- [ ] Rename operation is correctly recorded for undo/redo\n- [ ] Renaming works for deeply nested directories\n- [ ] Renaming to an existing directory name throws appropriate exception\n",
