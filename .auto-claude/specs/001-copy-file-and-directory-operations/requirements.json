  "task_description": "# Copy File and Directory Operations\n\nImplement copy operations for files and directories, including recursive directory copy with proper event emission and undo/redo support.\n\n## Rationale\nCopy is a fundamental file system operation that's currently missing. Users need this to simulate realistic file management workflows. This is a known gap in the current implementation.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a .NET developer, I want to copy files and directories in the virtual file system so that I can test code that performs backup or duplication operations\n- As a test author, I want copy operations to emit events so that I can verify my application reacts correctly to file copies\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CopyFile creates a new file with identical content at the target path\n- [ ] CopyDirectory recursively copies all files and subdirectories\n- [ ] FileCopied and DirectoryCopied events are emitted\n- [ ] Copy operations are added to change history for undo/redo\n- [ ] Attempting to copy to an existing path throws appropriate exception\n- [ ] Fluent API supports chaining copy operations\n",
